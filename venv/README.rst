This extension brings Scss support to Flask apps.

It is far from perfect or complete. Current features are the following:

- Automatic discovery of .scss assets
- Automatic compilation of .scss files
- Automatic refreshing of resulting .css files when .scss sources have changed

Scss files compilation is done by the
`pyScss <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyScss>`_ implementation by
German M. Bravo (Kronuz). Refer to this package documentation to see the
supported scss syntax.
